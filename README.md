## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM methodology (Block, Element, Modifier)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Semantic HTML](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand semantic HTML tags. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This complete guide explains everything about flexbox, focusing on all the different possible properties for the parent element (the flex container) and the child elements (the flex items).
- [Schemas.org](https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) - A collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data.

## SEO and Accessibility

### Microdata Integration

- Used `itemscope` and `itemtype` for the `article` to define it as a `Review`.
- Mapped `itemprop` attributes to content elements like `headline`, `description`, `image`, `creator`, `datePublished`, `thumbnail` and `author` for better semantic meaning and SEO.

### Accessibility Improvements

- Added `aria-labelledby` on the `article` to associate it with the headline, improving screen reader navigation.
- Updated the `alt` attribute of the image to provide a more descriptive and useful context.

### External Links

- Included `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for all external links to enhance security and performance.

### Semantic Structure

- Used a `figure` tag as a semantic tag that represents self-contained graphical content for images along with the `figcaption` tag used to define the caption for the image.
- Clearly defined elements with roles like `footer` and `main` for better screen reader support.

### Benefits

- **Search Engine Optimization**: The microdata ensures search engines can understand the content better, improving its ranking and rich snippets.
- **Enhanced Usability**: Screen readers can now interpret the purpose and structure of the content more effectively.
- **Security and Performance**: External links are safer with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
